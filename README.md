# QGAN_4_HEP_PURSUE

This repository contains code for benchmarking **Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QGANs)** against classical GANs for **High Energy Physics (HEP)** simulations, specifically jet image generation. This work was conducted under the **PURSUE program with USCMS and Fermilab** under the guidance of Dr. Sergei Gleyzer and Eric Reinhardt.

**Important:** If notebooks fail to render on GitHub, use [this](https://nbviewer.org/github/JaySeeDub/QGAN_4_HEP_PURSUE/tree/jet_mass/Notebooks/) link to view on nbviewer. 

## 🧠 Motivation

This (Q)GAN seeks to implement novel HEP-motivated metrics (ΔR and energy statistics), tuneable distribution output, feature-based discrimination, and implicit η symmetry from detector geometry. The model incorporates various physical features (signal, η, ϕ, p<sub>T</sub>, mass, ΔR, and statistical distributions) as codings for the generator, training it to produce a desired distribution of physically informed images. The discriminator is trained on the jet image and the feature codings (label, η, mass, p<sub>T</sub>), allowing it to learn classification of events from low-level detector data.

## 🗂️ Dataset

The primary training dataset is the **Jet Mass dataset** found [here](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/4r4v785rgx/1):

Nachman, Benjamin; de Oliveira, Luke; Paganini, Michela (2017), “Pythia Generated Jet Images for Location Aware Generative Adversarial Network Training”, Mendeley Data, V1, doi: 10.17632/4r4v785rgx.1

- `jet-images_Mass60-100_pT250-300_R1.25_Pix25.hdf5`
  - Contains: 25×25 calorimeter jet images
  - Labels: signal/background, η, ϕ, p<sub>T</sub>, mass, ΔR, etc.
  - Depends on Pythia, ROOT, FastJet and Python
  - Based on CMS detector simulations

## ⚙️ Project Features

- 🌀 **Quantum Layer**: A Pennylane-based `AmplitudeEmbedding` + `RandomLayers` quantum circuit encodes initial features.
- 🔁 **η-Symmetry Enforcement**: Images and features are flipped along η-axis, then the forward pass is averaged with the original to enforce physical invariance.
- 📊 **Statistical Losses**: Custom KL divergence losses over:
  - Mean and std of ΔR (jet radius)
  - Pixel intensity distribution
- 🔢 **Soft Nonzero Pixel Count**: A differentiable regularization loss that encourages characteristic image sparsity.
- 🧪 **Conditional Generation**: Generator conditioned on physics features (e.g. signal, η, p<sub>T</sub>, mass) sampled from KDE of real data.
- ✅ **Discriminator**: Jointly encodes images and physics features to classify real vs generated data.

## 🛠️ How to Run

**Recommended:** HPC CLuster with A100+ GPU

Training will be very slow without a powerful GPU.

```bash
conda create -n myenv python=3.10
conda activate myenv
pip install -r requirements.txt

git clone https://github.com/JaySeeDub/QGAN_4_HEP_PURSUE.git <your_directory_name>
cd <your_directory_name>/data
wget https://data.mendeley.com/public-files/datasets/4r4v785rgx/files/132306f6-26f4-4583-8f1b-ccc5ad8da05d/file_downloaded
mv file_downloaded jet-images_Mass60-100_pT250-300_R1.25_Pix25.hdf5
```
Navigate to Scripts/ (or Notebooks/ for interactive) and run the desired model. Sample model checkpoints are available to load from models/. If training from scratch, hyperparameters for loss terms, learning rate, KL divergence, etc will likely need to be tuned for best implementation.

## 📈 Sample Results:

Model Evaluation Summary:

-Both classical and quantum models were evaluated on 100,000 validation events.

-Key physics-based statistics were compared to assess distribution matching.
